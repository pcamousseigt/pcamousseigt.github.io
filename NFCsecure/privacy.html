  <h1>GDRP :</h1>
  <p>Advertisements partially fund the infrastructure (servers, APIs, etc.) used for my IT projects. Ads have been placed in the projects in such a way that they do not disrupt the user experience. The application uses AdMob from Google in order to display advertising. AdMob and its partners may use cookies and certain personal data for analysis, statistics, and to offer the advertisements most likely to interest the user. However, in application of the GDPR, the user can at any time decide how his personal data is used. The user may oppose the use of his personal data. This choice will not disable advertisements but will make them less relevant to the user.</p>
