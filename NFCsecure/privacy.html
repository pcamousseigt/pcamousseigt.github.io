  <h1>NFCsecure</h1>
  <p>NFCsecure allows you to remind you thanks to a notification that your NFC is enabled.</p>

  <h1>Advertisement</h1>
  <p>Advertisements partially fund the infrastructure (servers, APIs, etc.) used for my IT projects. Ads have been placed in the projects in such a way that they do not disrupt the user experience. The application uses AdMob from Google in order to display advertising. AdMob and its partners may use cookies and certain personal data for analysis, statistics, and to offer the advertisements most likely to interest the user. </p>
   
  <h1>GDPR</h1>
  <p>In application of the GDPR, the user can at any time decide how his personal data is used. The user may oppose the use of his personal data. This choice will not disable advertisements but will make them less relevant to the user.</p>
  <p>The application is hosted by Google.</p>

  <h1>Use of Data</h1>
  <p>Your personal data will be processed, and information related to your device (cookies, unique identifiers and other types of data) may be stored and accessed by third-party providers and shared with them, or used specifically by this site or this application.</p>
  <p>Some providers may process your personal data according to the principle of legitimate interest. You can object to this by managing your options directly in the mobile application NFCsecure.</p>
